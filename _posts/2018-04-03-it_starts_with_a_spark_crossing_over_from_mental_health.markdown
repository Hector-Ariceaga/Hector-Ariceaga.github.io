Mental health and web development. They are hardly the same, at least one could make that argument. Working with individuals suffering from mental health disorders must be messy, unorganized, without absolute answers, subjective, and just downright hard. I hear that a lot, working in mental health. While there is some truth to these assessments, and that is part of the appeal, there is also much more that is often unseen: the reward of patient improvement, the logic and order used to work a differential, the art of a well written and concise report, and the thrill of making headway in a very difficult case. 

It might be surprising for some that the same terms that describe working in healthcare, particularly mental health, could describe what it is like for me working with code. Sure, there are differences, from the obvious (working with computers versus working with people) to the more subtle (subjective vs objective measures of success), but the challenge, nuance, and thrill exist in both. It is these similarities and the complementary differences that made me begin to consider a career as a developer. 

There are few things in life that feel as rewarding as creating something, solving problems, and helping others. While I experience these rewards in abundance working in mental health, there is something unique about the sensation of having created a functional piece of code. I imagine it is how a professional painter must feel after completing a piece of fine art or an author completes a novel, perhaps not perfectly polished but complete and with the voice of the artist shining through. For the record, I recognize my experience with code thus far does not equate to the skills of a master artist. I do expect my skills to improve with time, but I also expect I will look at my code with the same feeling of accomplishment, perhaps more given the time I will have devoted to growing as a developer. 

I am looking forward to sharing my progress, reviewing my skills, and writing about my experiences going forward.
